# Numerical data types integers, long, float, complex
# These are numerical types which can use numerical operators
# complex and long we dont use much,
# complex for tracking two seperate variables
# long are integers of unlimited size
# Int and float
# Float are composite numbers with decimal places
# operators: +, -, /, *, % (moodulus), ** (indices), // (division, rounded down)

# Comparison operators --> boolean value
## ==, equating both
## <, >, less/greater than
## <=, =>, less/greater than or equal to
